# web-scraping-challenge

## Background

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.
What You're Creating

This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Part 1
In part 1 I was able to scrape titles and preview text of a website consisting Mars information using Splinter and Beautiful Soup. I stored all the data in a list so that it can be analyzed much more easily using Pandas.

## Part 2
In part 2 a very large table of weather information of Mars was given in a html web style, which I was abile to scrape and bring it over to a Python environment, essentially using the same method as Part 1. A Pandas dataframe was created, which then was analyzed to create not only numerical data but also visulized data using Matplotlib. For example, a line graph was made to show changes in minimum monthly temperature of Mars over a 12-month (Mars month) period. Other questions were also easily answered, such as the number of terrestrial days in a Marsian year -- all through web scraping and importing them into Pandas!
